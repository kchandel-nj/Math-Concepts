# Math-Concepts
In this repo, I will be applying techniques I learned in my various math classes to see how effective they would be when run by a computer.

Version 1.0:
Holds the first draft of the Sieve of Eratosthenes program, which filters prime numbers by eliminating identified prime multiples.

Version 1.1:
Fixed logical errors in the Sieve of Eratosthenes program.
Created the ConceptTesting file, which will be used to test all concepts implemented.
Imported the time library to measure execution time of functions.

Version 2.0:
Created the first draft of a Greatest Common Denominator finding program.
Implemented the first few tests for finding the GCD.

Version 2.1:
Fixed bugs with the Greatest Common Denominator program.

Version 2.1.5:
Merged all created concepts into one Concepts file.

Version 3.0:
Created and tested a method to factorize any number and return the prime factors.

Version 4.0:
Fixed critical bugs in the GCD method that would result in DivideByZero errors.
Created and tested a method to calculate the Least Common Multiple of any two numbers.

Version 5.0:
Created a method to calculate any root of any number using Binary Search.
