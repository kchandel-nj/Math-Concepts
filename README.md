# Math-Concepts
In this repo, I will be applying techniques I learned in my various math classes to see how effective they would be when run by a computer.

Version 1.1.0:
Holds the first draft of the Sieve of Eratosthenes program, which filters prime numbers by eliminating identified prime multiples.

Version 1.1.1:
Fixed logical errors in the Sieve of Eratosthenes program.
Created the ConceptTesting file, which will be used to test all concepts implemented.
Imported the time library to measure execution time of functions.
